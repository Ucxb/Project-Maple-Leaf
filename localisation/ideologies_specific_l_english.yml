 #GER_social_democrat_ideology_desc:0 "The Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD), Social Democratic Party of Germany, is the oldest major party in Germany amd was founded as a merger of the left-wing political movements ADAV and SDAP on May 27th, 1875.\n\nUnder the German Empire, the SPD was a radical left-wing force, including marxist and revolutionary socialist elements and had a platform which was skeptical of the power of the German monarch - which made it a prime target of political persecution for German chancellor Bismarck, who saw to enacting legal reforms that amounted to a ban on the SPD - bans that were lifted as late as 1890. As soon as the SPD re-entered the spotlight, they took the majority in the German Imperial Assembly. The SPD became more conformist and more willing to cooperate with conservative and centrist forces - however the marxist spark in the party remained. This spark sprung into a flame upon the outbreak of World War 1. The SPD was ideologically opposed to the war and could have prevented it by bankrupting the German Empire through a political blockade on additional loans. The members of the SPD were secretly pro-war however, managing to find an alibi to go to war in the liberation of the Russian working people from the yoke of Tsar Nicholas II.\nUpon Russia's defeat in 1917, the SPD broke - with the left-wing revolutionaries splitting into the USPD, the Independent Social Democrats. The main line SPD was however in favor of continuing the fight.\nAfter Germany's defeat, the two wings of the SPD ended up in civil war with one another - with the democratic forces eventually overpowering the communist ones because of the support from military and nationalistic forces. The SPD became a leading power in the Weimar Republic whereas the USPD ended up merging into the communist KPD. The SPD maintained a semi-marxist mantle, but was firmly pro-capitalism and pro-democracy at that point.\nUpon Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the SPD didn't bow down to his demands, putting a target upon their backs. SPD Leader Otto Wels even went into exile with a few loyalists to continue maintaining the SPD after it was outlawed in Germany itself.\nGermany ended up getting defeated in the Second World War as well and the SPD was among the forefront of building up a German democracy once again - at least in West Germany. In Soviet-occupied East Germany, the SPD was forced to join the KPD to become the SED, the ruling party of the later GDR. The SPD now faced another great party, the conservative CDU, as one of the main two factions. It took them until the Godesberg Program of 1959 to firmly take a stand against their ideological marxist roots, fully rooting them in the spectrum of Western European Social Democracy.\nThe SPD, from which three of the eight German chancellors - Brandt, Schmidt and Schröder - hail, is historically strong in urban areas and specifically in northern and western Germany."
