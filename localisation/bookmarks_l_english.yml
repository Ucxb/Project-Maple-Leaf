 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Millennium Dawn (Recommended)"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The world has changed. Globally speaking, an atmosphere of peace and prosperity has ruled for about half a century. But with the recent end of the Cold War, the recent rise of the People's Republic of China, how will this world see itself? How will it shape itself? Will the United States continue its dominance? Will the new Russian Federation find the way into the spotlight? What roles will the former great European empires of Britain, France and Germany play? And what role will the shadow of terrorism have? The world has changed. The world is changing."
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark is in a safe and sound spot, being both a member of the EU and NATO. Internal economic downturn and slowdown have however been recently challenging the Danish state."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has seen its last great colonial possession go. The once mightiest nation on earth is trying desperately to find a new path to greatness and glory. But will that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?"
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea."
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and is about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France, the Grande Nation of old, has tried to find a new spot in an ever-changing world. With old rivals and old friends firmly by her side, with new opponents and new threats on the horizon, France will have to decide if the future of the cradle of democracy shall be unity and peace or a return to more darker times."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Germany is now reunited for almost a decade. Economically stronger than ever, though with the outlook of a recession in the future, Germany needs to find new goals in this world. The freshly independent states of Eastern Europe are in the process of joining the European Union, where Germany holds significant influence. Germany, though troubled by its dark past, looks at a bright future."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After the defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought them back up to the state of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, the second-biggest economy on earth, has been the powerhouse of East Asian democracies ever since the Second World War ended. Backed by American and European allies and protected by a powerful industrial base, Japan looks at its old rival China with new confidence and new potential for conflict."
 NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to some point. Norway however still remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "China, the backwater of yesterday, is the super power of tomorrow. Its industrial base great, its political influence growing, its military modernizing and its workforce nearly infinite, China has to fear only one thing: If it reforms too slowly, it might be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly, it might destroy itself."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Where China is the super power of tomorrow, India is the super power of next week. Its constant struggles against Pakistan and China as well as its deep economic connection to the west have given India a niche to prosper. If it is given enough time, the Tiger of South Asia will be strong enough to take out every single one of its enemies."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was clear that the path back to glory would not be easy for the Russian Federation. The system and economy corrupt, the military big but outdated and the political outreach weakened, Russia had to accept to be on the sidelines for a decade. Now, it is looking to get back into the spotlight."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing only little to amend the issues. Sweden, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Neutral since times immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad in order to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The citizens of the United States have known little but victory in the last century. Winning the World Wars, winning the Cold War; the United States had a nearly perfect track record up until now. But with China emerging on the side of the ocean, with Russia pushing for renewed greatness, with terrorism an ever so great threat, what can America do to stay dominant?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Modern Day"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "With China claiming territorial waters around its coastlines, with Russia marching into Crimea, with the terrorist Islamic State proclaiming its caliphate, will the world stay the same? The United Kingdom is experiencing unwillingness to continue European integration. Recent terrorist attacks have the entirety of the French national principles shaken. Refugees are seeking shelter from wars and unrest in Syria and Libya. The next presidential election in the USA might be the most decisive one since 1940. The world is still changing."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignity not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "France has suffered from economic hardship and from major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their muslim and jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at a possibility to perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Germany, hit by refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbors grow increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren on Crimea. That about sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March of 2014. With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended. The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading. The next president of the United States will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on earth, the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
